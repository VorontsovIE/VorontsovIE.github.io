Hi, I am Ilya Vorontsov (Илья Воронцов), researcher and developer from Moscow, Russia.

I study gene regulation (in Vavilov Institute of General Genetics) using bioinformatician data analysis. You can take a look at my [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=hRn71foAAAAJ).

Here are some tools, I've developed at work.

Databases:
[HOCOMOCO](http://hocomoco.autosome.ru) - collection of transcription factor binding sites models. *Developed web-interface and backend. Performed a substatial part of data analysis.*
[Epifactors](http://epifactors.autosome.ru) - collection of epigenetic factors, corresponding genes and products. *Developed web-interface and backend.*

Web services:
[Web panel](http://opera.autosome.ru) to access several command line tools developed in our lab via web interface. *Developed web-interface, contributed to development of backend. Created some of the tools presented: [PerfectosAPE](http://opera.autosome.ru/perfectosape/), [MacroAPE](http://opera.autosome.ru/macroape/).*

My repositories: [github](https://github.com/VorontsovIE/), [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/VorontsovIE/).

Some of my side projects:
* [Study of working hours](https://habr.com/ru/post/359342/) in different countries based on sci-hub logs (only in Russian yet).
* [Interactive historical atlas](http://geo-history.org) based on parsing wikipedia, created by school students under my supervision.

Teaching activities:
* I'm one of the teachers and organisers of [**Slon**](https://vk.com/slon_ipm) summer school of applied programming.
* Currated several projects in bioninformatics at the [School of Molecular and Theoretical Biology](https://molbioschool.org/en/).
* Wrote part of training material for Python course in [Yandex.Lyceum](https://yandexlyceum.ru).

Technologies:
* Languages I speak: Russian (native), English (good enough to speak and write).
* Languages I write: Ruby (expert), Ruby on Rails (advanced), Python (advanced), Cython(intermediate), Java (intermediate), C++ (intermediate), Javascript (intermediate).
