Hi, I am Ilya Vorontsov (Илья Воронцов), researcher and developer from Moscow, Russia.

I study gene regulation in [Vavilov Institute of General Genetics](http://vigg.ru/) using bioinformatician data analysis (since 2012). 

My [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=hRn71foAAAAJ).

My repositories: [github](https://github.com/VorontsovIE/), [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/VorontsovIE/), [our lab github](https://github.com/autosome-ru/).

Here are some toolkits and services, I've developed at work.

Databases:
* [HOCOMOCO](http://hocomoco.autosome.ru) - collection of transcription factor binding sites models. *Developed web-interface and backend. Performed substantial part of data analysis.*
* [Epifactors](http://epifactors.autosome.ru) - collection of epigenetic factors, corresponding genes and products. *Developed web-interface and backend.*

Web services:
* [Web panel](http://opera.autosome.ru) to access several command line tools developed in our lab via web interface. *Developed web-interface, contributed to development of backend.*

Toolkits:
* [PerfectosAPE](http://opera.autosome.ru/perfectosape/) - java package to analyse effect of single nucleotide variant on transcription factor binding affinity
* [MacroAPE](http://opera.autosome.ru/macroape/) - java package to perform comparison of transcription factor binding motifs (represented as PWM-s) and P-value estimation for PWM score/
* [papolarity](https://github.com/autosome-ru/papolarity) - python toolkit to analyze ribosome distribution along transcripts from Ribo-seq data.
* [pasio](https://github.com/autosome-ru/pasio) - python/cython tool to perform segmentation/denoise of coverage profile into regions of constant Poisson parameter λ (given prior distribution λ ~ Γ(α,β)). *Tool originally developed by Andrey Lando, my part was in performance optimization and packaging.*

Some of my side projects:
* [Study of working hours](https://habr.com/ru/post/359342/) in different countries based on sci-hub logs (only in Russian yet).
* [Interactive historical atlas](http://geo-history.org) based on parsing wikipedia, created by school students under my (and my colleague) supervision.

Teaching activities:
* I'm one of the teachers and organisers of [**Slon**](https://vk.com/slon_ipm) summer school of applied programming.
* Currated several projects in bioinformatics at the [School of Molecular and Theoretical Biology](https://molbioschool.org/en/).
* Wrote part of training material for Python course in [Yandex.Lyceum](https://yandexlyceum.ru).
* Curate projects at [LearnPython](https://learn.python.ru) courses.
* Teach 10-th and 11-th grade students in Intellectual school.

Technologies:
* Languages I speak: Russian (native), English (good enough to speak and write).
* Languages I write: Ruby (expert), Python (advanced), Cython(intermediate), Java (intermediate), C++ (intermediate), Javascript (intermediate), bash (advanced).
* Other experience: Data analysis and visualization, Machine Learning, full-stack web-development (most experience with Ruby on Rails), docker, git, scraping, Linked Data with RDF and SPARQL, LaTeX.

Education:
Graduated Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology:
* Department of General and Applied Physics -- Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics (Math and Physics, bachelor's degree, 2011)
* Department of Innovation and High Technology -- Yandex School of Data Analysis (Math and Computer Science, master's degree, 2013)
* Vavilov Institute of General Genetics (Genetics, postgraduate study, 2017)

Career:
* 2012: development of marketplace for designers
* 2012 - now: Vavilov institute of General Genetics. Department of computational systems biology, research fellow

Here is my [CV in Russian](/static/VorontsovIE-CV-ru-informal.pdf).
